Section 2. Overview of Cloud Computing

What is Cloud Computing ?

- gmail
- facebook
- dropbox

Cloud Computing : 
- the on-demand delivery of IT services from a third-party provider over the Internet

Cloud Service : 
- The IT capability that is being provided by the cloud provider
- gmail : email
- facebook : social networking
- dropbox : storage

"pay as you go" : typical, only pay for what you use


Enterprise Organization Examples
================================
- website
  - website & storage up in the cloud
  - cloud takes care of scaling storage and/or servers to handle customer demand

- order system
  - order system ui
  - db to hold orders
    - perform analytics to 'plan' future business
    - do on the cloud only when analytics are needed
  - scaling handled by cloud

Cloud Characteristics {technical}
=====================
- on-demand, self-service
  - cmds consume resources on a remote site
- broad network access
  - connect to the service, eg internet {eg, AWS}, WANs
- resource pooling
  - resources used by multiple users
- rapid elasticity
  - scaling - resources to handle more users, storage
  - elasticity - scale up / down
- measure service
  - monitored so you pay for what you use

Service Models
==============
- On-premises / private cloud
  - all managed by you
- IaaS - Infrastructure
  - AWS EC2 - request a virtual server
  - but once AWS gives it to you - you have to manage it, eg the OS, runtime libraries, data & code
- PaaS - Platform
  - developer uploads code to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - but once AWS gives it to you - you have to manage just data & code
- SaaS - Software
  - Sales Team logs sales data into Salesforce.com
  - all managed by provider
    - users just consume the service, eg gmail, facebook, dropbox


Deployment Models
=================
- where are your resources deployed
- private cloud
  - dedicated environment but it's all yours - eg VMWare, RedHat, OpenStack
  - benefits :
    - complete control, eg data security reasons
- public cloud
  - AWS, MS Azure, Google Cloud Platform
  - these companies need LOTS of resources 
    - so they buy all that which allows them to charge lower costs than if private company had to buy that much
  - benefits :
    - variable expense
    - scaling, elasticity
- hybrid cloud
  - combination of private / public
  - benefits :
    - allow companies to use private for certain proprietary components and public for 'common'
- multicloud
  - use multiple clouds, eg Azure, AWS
  - why ? different services, price points, etc


Legacy IT
=========
- old way of doing things
- companies need :
  - data centers, power, computing equipment, software licenses, maintenance, staff wages, etc
- requires lots of 
  - capital
  - operational overhead {maintenance, wages}
  - limited scalability


6 Advantages of Cloud {as told by AWS}
=====================
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/six-advantages-of-cloud-computing.html
- Trade capital expense for variable expense
  - no need for $$ for data centers
- benefits from massive economies of scale
- stop guessing about capacity
  - cloud takes care of knowing storage capacity, num of users, etc - consumer doesn't need to
- increase speed & agility
- stop spending $$$ running & maintaining data centers
- go global in minutes
